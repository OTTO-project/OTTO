# OTTO: Totally Original Project-1
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/topisani/OTTO.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/topisani/OTTO)

Ah, who doesnt love the [op-1](http://teenage.engineering/products/op-1)? Its a magical beast of modern technology! Everything you need to play around with electronic music, in one self-contained device. Its pretty close to perfect, but not quite - its simplicity is its power, but it's also the source of its shortcomings. And then of course, it's not open source.

Come chat with me at my [discord server](https://discord.gg/4cV9Ucz) if you're interested in the project.

### Introducing the OTTO!  
To be fair, the OTTO is an op-1 clone. But i like to think it's a bit more than that. Some differences will be subtle, and some differences will be big. Especially the non-core modules will differ greatly, as most of them are designed fully independently. The UI too varies, from the tapedeck, which is practically the same, to the metronome, which is very different (see both below);

</div>

# Current Progress  
The tapedeck is completed, with a few bugs left to iron out, and with the addition of the metronome, mixer, and input selector, the software is just about ready to be used for recording with external synthesizers. It runs in an OpenGLFW window, and the buttons and rotaries are emulated with keyboard shortcuts.

# Keybindings
These are the keybindings currently emulating the hardware buttons:

| Key         | Action              | Key                 | Action              |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|

| F3          | Track 3             | F4                  | Track 4             |
| Ctrl + T    | Tape                | Ctrl + Y            | Mixer               |
| Ctrl + U    | Synth               | Ctrl + G            | Metronome           |
| I           | Go to Loop In       | Shift + I           | Set Loop In         |
| O           | Go to Loop Out      | Shift + O           | Set Loop Out        |
| L           | Toggle Looping      | Ctrl + X            | Cut Tape Selection  |
| Ctrl + C    | Lift Tape Selection | Ctrl + V            | Drop Tape Selection |

# Future Plans
 - [ ] Input selection screen - select external audio, internal audio, or the mixer output
 - [ ] Sequencers - A few basic ones are planned
 - [ ] Synthesizers - One or two simple synths
 - [ ] Effects - Filter, EQ, Delay, Bit crushing etc
 - [ ] Sampler - This is the big one!
 - [ ] Modulation - LFO mainly
And from there its just modules, modules, modules

# Installation
The bellow details are outdated, take a look at `.travis.yml` to see a way to install it. I will update these instructions soonâ„¢

# Docker
The recommended way to run and develop for the OTTO is using the docker image. It includes all the required tools and dependencies, and should work out of the box on any linux machine.
```bash
cd OTTO
docker build . -t otto/topisani
```
Then to run the docker image
```bash
sh dockerrun.sh
```
This will build the source, and run OTTO, patchage and jack-keyboard.
The source will be mounted into docker from the current directory, so the image will not need to be rebuilt when the source is updated.

## Faust in docker
Most of the DSP is done using [faust](http://faust.grame.fr), which is preinstalled in the docker image. If you change any of the `.dsp` files, you will need to compile them by running
```bash
sh dockerrun.sh ./compile-faust.sh
```
If you are'nt using the docker image, check the manual faust section bellow.

## Pulseaudio
If you are using pulseaudio, you may have to pause it while running the docker container. This means you won't hear any sound from other applications.
To automatically suspend pulseaudio and restart it when OTTO closes, run the container like this:
```bash
pasuspender -- sh dockerrun.sh
```
# Manual Installation  
Install the dependencies. For Debian 9+/Ubuntu 16.10+, this should do the trick
```bash
apt install jackd\
    cmake\
    gcc\
    g++\
    pkg-config\
    libglfw3-dev\
    libedit-dev\
    libjack-jackd2-dev\
    libgles2-mesa-dev -y
```
**NOTE:** On Debian 8-/Ubuntu 16.04-, you will get errors about missing openGL files, and i have no idea why. Either use the docker image, upgrade your system, or try installing GLFW 3.2 from source.

I recommend also installing `patchage` and `jack-keyboard`, but they are in no way required.

With this set up, you can build & run the OTTO with
```
cmake .
make -j4
bin/tapedeck
```
or with the provided `install.sh` script.

It should be possible to get the OTTO running on Windows/Mac too, but for now you are on your own with that. If you do succeed in doing it, we'd apreciate a guide added to this README

## Manual Faust
If you change the `.dsp` files, you will need faust to compile them.
It is very important that you use the correct version, which currently is `0.9.104`. To install that, run the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust
cd faust
git checkout 24db8d98e63aa8a119ffc601bf6aeec3e33e7a86
make
sudo make install
```
Once you have faust installed, verify that the `faust` command uses the correct version. You should see something like this:
```bash
$ faust --version
FAUST, DSP to C++ compiler, Version 0.9.104
Copyright (C) 2002-2017, GRAME - Centre National de Creation Musicale. All rights reserved. 
```

Then, make the apropriate changes in the `.dsp` files, and compile them by running
```
sh compile-faust.sh
```
faust especially is a lot easier to use with the docker image, even if you are running everything else outside it.

# Getting Involved
If you're up for it, I'd love some help, for a lot of different things, like
 - Software testing
 - Writing documentation
 - Hardware design / testing
 - UI design
 - Creating default samples & settings
and of course, the coding itself, with areas like
 - Synth/Effect design (I know very little about dsp)
 - General backend design
 - Hardware bridging
 - Distro setup - a custom distro for the Pi might be necessary

If you are interested, come chat with me at my [discord server](https://discord.gg/4cV9Ucz).
